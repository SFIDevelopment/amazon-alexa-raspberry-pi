# Turning a Raspberry Pi 3 into an Alexa Voice Service with Resin.io

The project is based on another [Alexa client
project](https://github.com/alexa-pi/AlexaPi).
We use the aforementioned project along with docker and the
[Resin.io](https://dashboard.resin.io) platform to achieve
a remote development.

#### Detailed installation instructions can be found in my [blogspot](https://evasar.io/blog/turning-a-raspberry-pi-into-an-alexa-voice-service-with-resin-io-2-2/).
